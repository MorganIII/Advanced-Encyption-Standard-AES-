# Advanced-Encyption-Standard-AES-
## The Advanced Encryption Standard or AES is a symmetric block cipher used by the U.S. government to protect classified information and is implemented in software and hardware throughout the world to encrypt sensitive data. The AES operates on a 128 bit bursts as well as 128 bits key
## The implementation of one cycle of AES algorithm as follows
### 1)	Build two Procedures based on interrupts that reads 128 bits from the user and prints the result on the screen.
### 2)	Use Macros to implement SubBytes(), ShiftRows(), MixColumns(), AddRoundKey() modules, all work on 128 bits.
### 3)	For the AddRoundkey module consider the used key of FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF.
