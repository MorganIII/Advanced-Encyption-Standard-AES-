# Advanced-Encyption-Standard-AES-
## <sub>The Advanced Encryption Standard or AES is a symmetric block cipher used by the U.S. government to protect classified information and is implemented in software and hardware throughout the world to encrypt sensitive data. The AES operates on a 128 bit bursts as well as 128 bits key.</sub>
## The implementation of one cycle of AES algorithm as follows
### <sub>1) Build two Procedures based on interrupts that reads 128 bits from the user and prints the result on the screen</sub>.
### <sub>2) Use Macros to implement SubBytes(), ShiftRows(), MixColumns(), AddRoundKey() modules, all work on 128 bits</sub>.
### <sub>3) For the AddRoundkey module consider the used key of FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF FF</sub>.
